I have made some functions that make it easy to add modded monuments to EU4.

## Instructions:

Start by opening EU4 Paradox Launcher. Go to `All installed mods` and click `Upload Mod` and then click `Create a mod`.

Then name the mod, put in a `version` (NOT game, version, but modversion like 1.0). And write in a folder name after `/mod` that is descriptive of the mod, add tags if you want (my script adds "gameplay" and "expansion" by default.

Then close the paradox launcher and navigate to you mod folder.
